<div>
    <p>This parameter is a special cascade choice parameter. It was
    designed based on the cascade choice parameter, so it is also
    able to re-render itself whenever another parameter changes.</p>

    <p>The difference of this parameter is that users have more
    freedom on how the HTML element is rendered (if rendered at
    all). This is useful in cases where users want to display a
    custom HTML element, write JavaScript that renders something
    like D3.js or another JavaScript library.</p>
